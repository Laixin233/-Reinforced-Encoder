## Towards Enhancing Encoder-only Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting
This is the PyTorch implementation of the original paper, 'Towards Enhancing Encoder-only Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting'. ReEnc-PPO4Pred is a novel reinforcement learning-based framework that enhances encoder-only RNNs for time series forecasting by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, enabling adaptive input feature selection, hidden skip connections, and output target selection.
